# Real-World_Database_Solution
You have been hired as a junior system admin at a small company who is looking to set up a  new server to run a database for their new HR system. The head of the IT team has requested  you to install and properly configure both the OS and a suitable DBMS on the server to use  for this need. 


 Database Security

1. Install the oracle DBMS on the machine on the Linux distribution you installed.
2. Identify 5 configurations you must do to harden that distribution and explain why it increases the security and the attacks it protects against and carry those out.
3. Implement a suitable simple ERD suitable to be used in a HR system in that database and enter appropriate sample data.
  a. Should be a minimum of 5 tables with more than 5 attributes each.
  b. Should include 1:M and M:N relationships
  c. Each table should include at least 10 records of sample data.
4. The roles of people accessing this database can be System Admin, Manager and Executive. Create the 3 users in the DBMS and allocate the below roles/user permissions to them.
  a. System Admin – Full permissions including all system permissions.
  b. Manager – No system permissions, only allowed to read from and write to the database.
  c. Executive - No system permissions, only allowed to read from the database.
5. Create a view that allows Managers to view the personal and salary details of the people who work for them.
6. Create a VPD that matches the functionality of the view required in the above question.
7. Identify a subset of the data in your database that requires higher security and encrypt that data with suitable encryption options.
8. If you were to allow access to the database for a consulting firm identify potentially sensitive/private information and mask that data appropriately.
9. Identify and implement a suitable FGA policy for your database.
